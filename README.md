# employee-management-system

You can check out the app here: http://employee-management-system-demo.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com

I built this small application to continue getting practice and increase my familiarity with Spring. This particular application was built with Spring Boot. 

Some of the features I was able to get familiar with were pagination and sorting using Spring's Pageable interface and Sort class. I also implemeneted a search feature that uses @Query annotation to handle the query. I used Thymeleaf as well for some of the views so I'm getting more familiar with that as well! :)

I also wanted to get some entry-level familiarity with Amazon Web Services so I deployed the application to the cloud using AWS's Elastic BeanStalk. In addition, I have the application connected to a MySQL database that is also hosted on AWS using RDS, making this a fully cloud-hosted application.
